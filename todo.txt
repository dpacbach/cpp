* create al module with al object that stores
  efficiently the contents and can yield them
  as an iterator (pairs or 2-tuples?).
  should it store a full list of pairs?

  must by symmetric in both values

  can be mutable in the sense of adding new
  elements.  It can represent data internally
  with both keys and values as vectors. how
  to construct and distinguish between vectors
  as values and vector as list of values?
  should automatically unpack?

  it can accept a vector of pairs
  or a vector of two-tuples (same thing?).

  get list of unique keys and unique vals
  (not sorted)

  implemented with index map? BDMap?

  create from list and key function (val function)
  or list and both key/val functions

* insert_many_fast 1 which takes a function to
  use to convert the argument to the string tuple.
  this could also be used to select an element
  from a tuple and convert it to string.

* equivalent to catMaybes

* read solution file from string
