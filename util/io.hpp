// fully copying files  on  Windows  that  were  created on Linux.
// Specifically, it was observed that,  copying  a text file with
// Linux  line endings on Windows resulted in a new file with Win-
// dows line endings, which is  not  desired.  Hence we have this
// function which will copy the file in  binary  mode  faithfully.

// listing for all files (and folders if flag is true) that match
// the glob pattern. Only *  and  ?  are supported, and those spe-
// cial  characters  can only appear in the file name of the path.
// The filename (with wildcard characters)  must match the entire
// file name from start to finish. If one of the folders  in  the
// path  does  not  exist, an exception is thrown. If the path is
// relative then it is relative to CWD. Paths returned will  have
// their  absolute/relative  nature  preserved  according  to the
// input  p.  Also,  if input path is empty, it will return empty.

// function does not give  any  special  treatment to files whose
// names begin with a dot ("hidden files" on Linux).
