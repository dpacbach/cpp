/* Implementation of lexically_normal.  Put  a  path  into normal

 * follow symlinks). The C++17 filesystem library has this method
 * as a member function of  the  path  class,  but it has not yet
 * been implemented in gcc at the time of this writing. Once  gcc
 * 8 is released, then this function can probably be deleted  and
 * the  usage of it can be replaced with p.lexicaly_normal(). How-
 * ever, note that  the  implementation  of  this  function  will
 * likely be slightly different from  the  one in the standard li-
 * brary.  In  particular,  at  the  moment,  it does not convert
 * slashes  using  make_preferred. Note that the code doesn't per-
 * form these actions in the same  order  as the steps below, but
 * the overall effect should be the same.
 *
 * From http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem/path, a  path
 * can be normalized by following this algorithm:
 *
 *  1) If the path is empty, stop (normal form of an  empty  path
 *     is an empty path)
 *  2) Replace each directory-separator  (which  may  consist  of
 *     multiple slashes) with  a single path::preferred_separator.
 *  3) Replace each slash character in the root-name with
 *     path::preferred_separator.
 *  4) Remove each dot and any immediately following
 *     directory-separator.
 *  5) Remove each non-dot-dot filename immediately followed by a
 *     directory-separator and a dot-dot, along with  any  immedi-
 *     ately following directory-separator.
 *  6) If there is  root-directory,  remove  all dot-dots and any
 *     directory-separators immediately following them.
 *  7) If the  last  filename  is  dot-dot,  remove  any trailing
 *     directory-separator.
 *  8) If the path is empty, add  a  dot (normal form of ./ is .)

 * implementation of this function will likely  be  slightly  dif-
 * ferent from the one in the standard library.
 *
 * Return value: empty path on error, result otherwise.
 *
 * NOTE: both arguments will  be  normalized, and result returned
 * will always be in normal form  unless an error (empty path) is
 * returned.
 *
 * NOTE:  this function doesn't always work right in certain edge
 * cases involving both relative paths and the presence of double
 * dots  in the base  path due to  the fact that  this is lexical.
 * The function  tries to detect these scenarios  and will return
 * an error (empty  path) in those cases.
 *
 * From en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem/path/lexically_normal
 * the algorithm is as follows:
 *
 *   if (root_name()   != base.root_name() ) ||
 *      (is_absolute() != base.is_absolute() ||
 *      (!has_root_directory() && base.has_root_directory())
 *        returns a default-constructed path.
 *
 *   Otherwise,  determines the first mismatched element of *this
 *   and base as if by:
 *
 *      auto [a, b] = mismatch(begin(), end(),
 *                             base.begin(), base.end())
 *
 *      if  a  ==  end()  and b == base.end(), returns path(".");
 *
 *   Otherwise,  if the number of dot-dot filename elements in [b,
 *   base.end())  is greater than the number of filename elements
 *   that are neither dot nor  dot-dot,  returns  a  default  con-
 *   structed path. otherwise returns an object composed from:  a
 *   default-constructed path() followed by as many  applications
 *   of operator/=(path("..")) as there were filename elements in
 *   [b,  base.end())  that  are  neither  dot  nor dot-dot minus
 *   number  of  dot-dot  elements in that range, followed by one
 *   application of operator/= for each element in the  half-open
 *   range [a, end())
