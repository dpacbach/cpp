/****************************************************************
* Time formatting
****************************************************************/
// Introduction:
//
// In this library, by default, we measure points in time  as  du-
// rations of time since an Epoch time of Jan 1  1970,  but  this
// Epoch time carries no time zone  qualifier  -- time zone is un-
// specified. Even such types as  time_t or chrono time_point are
// interpteted this way. As such, they do not specify an absolute
// point in time without a  supplemental  time zone qualifier. We
// refer to these time measures as "local Epoch time." We can use
// any time type as a local Epoch time, such  as  time_t,  chrono
// seconds, chrono time points, chrono minutes, etc.
//
// There  is  only one type that is used to represent an absolute
// time, and that is  the  zoned_time_point.  See  above for more
// info on that class. Essentially, it is just a trivial  wrapper
// around some local Epoch time that exists in order to force the
// creator  to  be  explicit  about the time zone with respect to
// which the local Epoch time is interpreted.
//
// Hence, among the time formatting  functions that we have below,
// the only formatting function that will emit  time  zone  quali-
// fiers  when  formatting  times  is  the  overload that takes a
// zoned_time_point. All of the other  overloads  will  format  a
// time with as much precision as  that  type allows, but will al-
// ways stop short of attaching a time zone qualifier.

// To start off, we  explicitly  delete  the  overload that takes
// time_t  because  we want to discourage using it in general. If
// you need to format a time_t then what you should do is  explic-
// itly construct a chrono::seconds  and  call  the next overload.
std::string fmt_time( time_t time ) = delete;

// Formats  a  local  epoch  time specified in seconds in the fol-
// lowing format: "2018-01-15 20:52:48". Strings of this form can
// be compared lexicographically for he  purposes of comparing by
// time ordering.
std::string fmt_time( std::chrono::seconds time );

// Formats a local epoch time represented by a system clock  time
// point in  the  format:  "2018-01-15  20:52:48.421397398".  The
// output will always be precisely 29  characters  long;  if  the
// time point given to the function does  not  have  nano  second
// precision then latter digits may just be  padded  with  zeroes.
// Note that strings of  this  form  can be compared lexicographi-
// cally to compare ordering.
std::string fmt_time( SysTimePoint const& p );

// Formats a zoned time point by first adjusting its duration  ac-
// cording  to the time zone offset given, then formatting the du-
// ration type as a local epoch time  using one of the other fmt_-
// time functions, then finally attaching a time  zone  qualifier.
// The length of the output depends on the duration type on which
// zt_point is parametrized,  since  that  depends which fmt_time
// function  gets called to format that duration. However, if the
// DurationT  is a chrono system_clock time point then the output
// will always be precisely 34 characters  long and will have the
// formats, for example:
//
//     2018-01-15 15:52:48.421397398-0500
//     2018-01-15 20:52:48.421397398+0000
//
// NOTE: these strings cannot be  compared  lexicographically  un-
// less the timezones are the same.
