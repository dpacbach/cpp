SQLite:

    open connection to file
    open connection with multiple databases

    query returning results
    query not returning any results

    query taking parameters

    query inserting many rows

    with_connection function

    vacuum

    compatibility with types used

other:

    need to parse a SolutionFile from string

wrappers:

    maybe:

        sqlite_modern_cpp (https://github.com/SqliteModernCpp/sqlite_modern_cpp):

            + somewhat modern c++ interface
            + currently maintained
            + blob support with vector<>
            + transaction support
            + can access underlying db connection
            + support null values with std::optional
            + variant type support
            + good error handling support
            + native custom function support

        sqlite3pp (https://github.com/iwongu/sqlite3pp):

            + currently maintained
            + no dependencies
            + could potentially work if nothing better

        SQLiteCpp (https://github.com/SRombauts/SQLiteCpp):

            + currently maintained
            + no dependencies
            + linux/win/osx
            + as thread safe as sqlite itself
            - pre C++11

    no:

        sqlite_orm (https://github.com/fnc12/sqlite_orm):

            - seems to be designed for object databases
            - based around performing sql operations with
              C++ functions
            - provides unneeded functionality
            - modern, but not quite modern-enough C++

        CppSQLite3:

            - 2011, unmaintained
            - amateur looking

        sqlite.cpp (https://www.dlbeer.co.nz/oss/sqlite.html):

            - extremely light
            - seems unsophisticated type-wise
